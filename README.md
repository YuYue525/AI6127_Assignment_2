# AI6127_Assignment_2

## task 1:
In the file `add_rouge_2.py`, we add rouge 2 matrix based on the example code base and use GRU encoder and decoder.
```
python add_rouge_2.py
```

## task 2:
In the file lstm.py, we use LSTM-based encoder and LSTM-based decoder.
```
python lstm.py
```

## task 3:
In the file bilstm.py, we use BiLSTM-based encoder and GRU decoder.
```
python bilstm.py
```

## task 4:
In the file attention.py, we add attention mechanism between the GRU encoder and decoder.
```
python attention.py
```
